# FullStackProject

Brief.

To create a functioning CRUD application which had a fully functioning front end. My CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application was built by using the concepts and theory taught during prior training.

This project includes:

Project Management (KanBan Board + Version Control)
DataBases (SQL)
Java
Spring Boot
HTML + CSS + Javascript
Back-end testing (Junit and Mockito)
Front-end testing
KANBAN Board (Jira).

For my KanBan board I used Jira and used the template of an Agile Scrum Board. Here is a link: https://lilfinn.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/FPB/boards/4 I used Epics to add structure, and then created user stories to create a clear plan of what was to do, and what has been done.

DataBases (SQL).

I used two databases for this project. I used a h2 Console because data doesn't persist, my SQL is perminatly stored so it is accessible at every point.

Backend(Eclipse & Java).

The back end of my project is powered by Java using a Spring Boot Framework. I used Java because it is object oriented language (oop) so because of this it allows us to make programmes such as the one I have created.
I used Spring boot to make it a running software.

GitHub

I followed the main/development/feature branch model. However, for the future I need to make sure I am pushing up more regularily and I will next time create more branches.

Testing.

I used Junit and Mockito for unit testing, and for integration testing I used MockMVC.

HTML + CSS + Javascript.

I used HTML + CSS + Javascript + Bootstrap. Javascript - to make functionalities such as connecting front end to back end, and also to create functionality for the site itself. 
HTML - I used this language to create structure for the page, and for design purposes.
CSS - Used this to add in aesthetics and style, such as background colout and font size
Bootstrap - I used this tool to again help with the design of the page, mainly for layout and creating a grid structure.

Acknowledges.

I would like to say thank you to Jordan Harrison, and Jordan Benbelaid for providing lots of helpful material and helping me with any queries or issues I have faced.
